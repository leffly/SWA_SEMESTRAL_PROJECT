Semestral project (40+5 points)
1. Codebase – one codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys

```diff
- separate repositories for each microservice (1)
+ continuous integration to build, test and create the artefact (3)
+ implement some tests and test each service separately (unit tests, integration tests) (5)
```

2. Dependencies – explicitly declare and isolate dependencies

```diff
+ preferably Maven project with pom.xml
```

3. Config

```diff
+ configuration of services provided via environmental properties (1)
- eventually as configuration as code (bonus: 0.5)
```
        
4. Backing services – treat backing services as attached resources

```diff
+ backing services like database and similar will be deployed as containers too (1)
```

5. Build, release, run – strictly separate build and run stages

```diff
- CI & docker
- eventually upload your images to docker hub (bonus: 1)
```

6. Processes

```diff
+ execute the app as one or more stateless processes (1)
```


7. Port binding

```diff
+ export services via port binding (1)
```


8. Disposability – maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown

```diff
+ ability to stop/restart service without catastrophic failure for the rest (2)
```

9. Dev/prod parity – keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible

```diff
- repository for integration testing and system demonstration (2)
+ services will be deployed as containers
```

10. Logs – treat logs as event streams

```diff
+ log into standard output (1)
- eventually collect logs in Elastic (bonus: 0.5)
```

11. Communication

```diff
+ REST API defined using Open API standard (Swagger) (2)
+ auto-generated in each service (1)
+ clear URLs (2)
+ clean usage of HTTP statuses (2)
+ eventually message based asynchronous communication via queue (bonus: 1)
```

12. Transparency – the client should never know the exact location of a service.

```diff
+ service discovery (2)
- eventually client side load balancing (bonus: 0.5) or workload balancing (bonus: 0.5)
```

13. Health monitoring – a microservice should communicate its health

```diff
+ Actuators (1)
- eventually Elastic APM (bonus: 1)
```

14. Design patterns

```diff
+ use the appropriate patterns (2)
```


15. Scope

```diff
+ use domain driven design or similar to design the microservices (5)
```


16. Documentation

```diff
+ visually communicate architecture of your system (5)
```
